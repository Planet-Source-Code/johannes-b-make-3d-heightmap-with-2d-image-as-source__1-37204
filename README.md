### Description

This code takes a 2D image (jpeg,bmp,gif,tga,pcx and many more) and converts it to a 3D heightmap. This is a realy cool 3D effect. Also please try the spike rendering mode that has a very smooth look. You can also use shaded colors to get a very cool effect on the drawed map!

Sample source images are included in zip file and the .bmp pictures looks realy cool with spike rendering mode! I also wanna thank the authors of the tga and pcx code! Please vote!
